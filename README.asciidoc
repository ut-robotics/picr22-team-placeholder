=== Used libraries

[horizontal]
numba:: used JIT to speed up our line detection
numpy:: arrays, operations related to image processor
opencv_python:: used for the camera
pyrealsense2:: used for the camera
pyPS4Controller:: using a DualShock 4 controller for remote control purposes
pyserial:: used for serial connection with the mainboard
tomli:: used for .toml configuration files to easily access and modify configurable variables
websocket_client:: using websockets for getting referee commands
random:: randomize some choices to make the game more interesting
time:: get the current time in order to compare it to a previous time, mainly used for timeouts. Uses sleep in remote control for waiting.

datetime:: get the current time in a pretty format, used for log file names
os:: checking whether directories exist and making them
pathlib:: checking if a file exists and if not, then making it. This could've been done with "os" too, but I used pathlib for some reason.

threading:: used to run the remote control code at the same time as the rest of the code
_pickle:: serializing python objects
segment:: C library from the example code, used for fast colour thresholding

=== About the code
The main components of the code are:

* image processor
* motion calculation
* remote control
* referee component
* main state machine

The image processor makes use of the camera to find baskets and balls in the current frame, giving us data that we can use to make decisions on where to go.

Motion calculation part gets the speeds in metres, then converts them to mainboard units and sends them to the mainboard. 

Remote control lets us use a DualShock 4 controller to shut down the robot at any time or to remote control it whenever we want to. The code makes use of threading to run at the same time as the main state machine, in case we need to quickly shut down the robot in an emergency.

The referee component listens for any valid referee commands and adds them to the queue for the main state machine to check whenever necessary.

The main state machine is where the magic happens. It gets the camera data from image processor and listens for any commands from referee server before entering a state. If the robot is not being remote controlled, it will enter into one of these states:

[horizontal]
Stopped:: the robot is stopped, it is not doing anything other than listening for commands.
Searching:: the robot searches for a ball until it finds one, then it enters DriveToBall state
DriveToBall:: the robot drives close enough to the ball until it is in Orbiting range
Orbiting:: the robot starts to orbit around the ball to line it up with the basket. When the ball and basket are aligned, the robot will enter BallThrow state
BallThrow:: the robot activates the thrower based on the current basket distance, keeps slightly adjusting the thrower speed for the first frames of a throw and then drives into the ball, hopefully throwing it into the basket. Afterwards, the robot enters Searching state again.
EscapeFromBasket:: in case the robot gets too close to the basket, it will reverse and try to get away from the basket. Afterwards, it'll continue searching.
RemoteControl:: this is the state when the robot is being remote controlled, it will not do anything else.

Here's a block diagram of the game logic:

=== Retrospective

The performance could've been better - we always made use of aligning depth, even when we could've gotten away by using the Y coordinate instead. This was a major performance hit.

Our line detection also wasn't perfect - it just checked how many black and white pixels there are around a ball. It did work well enough, but actual line detection would have been less error-prone. The current system also ignored balls close to opponents sometimes.

There were issues with calculating the distance to the opposite basket when another robot was blocking the way. I did try to remedy it by getting the distance from higher up and checking only the correct colour pixels, but it still had issues sometimes.

I did like how our code was structured - we use a class, so variables are easily available. We also can't confuse local and global variables, which is a good thing. Whenever a variable is missing, it'll complain instead of letting it go through. I also implemented logging, which was actually very helpful in debugging certain issues. While printing lines to the terminal window works, there's just so much data that you won't be able to read it all. Saving it to a log let's you look back and see what was wrong. It didn't even take much time to implement.

== Electronics
### Board functionality

- Consists of two isolated boards: mainboard with all the logic components and the motor driver boards

- Mainboard is powered through USB, motor driver board is powered from battery

- Motor driver uses a transistor for reverse current protection

- Mainboard has a voltage regulator to convert 5V to 3V3 with a POWER GOOD LED and motor driver board has a 16V to 5V regulator

- Mainboard sends control signals to motor driver boards through digital isolators

- Communication between STM32 controller and computer happens through microUSB

- STM32 has a LED for indicating program status

- Microcontroller can be programmed and debugged with the STLINK-V3MINI debugger/programmer through the SWD interface

- Mainboard has three connectors for motor encoders

- Mainboard controls the motors by sending a separate PWM and direction signal to each of the three motors, it also sends the motor sleep command to all of the motors

- Mainboard also sends the PWM signal to the thrower motor

- Motor driver board has three motor drivers which can be controlled either with two PWM signals or one PWM and one DIR signal, which is determined by the MODE pin, we use one PWM one DIR by connecting MODE to MGND through 0R

- Motor SLEEP pin needs 20us low pulse before sending PWM

- Motor drivers has SR for slew rate control and DIAG for debug, both of which are connected to MGND through 0R

- Motor driver can be limited by connecting resistors from ITRIP and PROP to MGND. Our maximum motor current is a bit above 2A selected by 47K resistor for ITRIP and 3K3 resistor for PROP

== Mechanics

=== If you used something different from what was given at the start of the course or did something different, describe it.

I'm not sure what this question means by "something different from what was given". Only custom equipment was Artur's controller, custom chassis and wheels. Rest of the parts which were given got used. We did replace one short-circuted motor though.

=== Description of the main points of interest in your ball thrower design and construction process.

The initial thrower had to fit the test robot chassis, which was the main constraint. Later on I decided to keep using the same thrower because it was already there and functional. Main point of interest however was the angle at which the ball was thrown out. For that we made 2 revisions, where the angles varied. We decided to keep using the first revision, since we had already done motor power/distance calculations on it (also read: sunk cost fallacy).

=== Photos of your robot.

=== A short analysis of what was good and bad in your mechanics and how to improve.

First and foremost, the design was functional and served its purpose. I tried to make it simple (as in plug-and-play to assemble) and the parts interchangable (less designs overall).
However nothing is perfect. I had to cut the upper plate, since it was in the way of the ball when throwing (maybe it was not so wise to make bottom and upper plates the same design). A major improvement would've been to make the thrower adjustable, so you could change between angles easily without having to make different different-angled parts. While we're at it, redesign the thrower entirely so it could've fit better with the "one plate to rule them all" philosophy.

== Personal comments

=== Timo

==== On which parts of the robot did you work on?

I mainly worked on the software side of things - programming. My job was to get the robot moving and actually compete with others. I also had to sometimes deal with mechanics ane electronics related things. I think I've disassembled the robot more times than the mechanic and electronic combined.

==== What did you learn?

I learned more about state machines, Python features that I hadn't used before, such as enums and overall tips on how to keep my code somewhat readable and functional. I also learned how to actually make a three wheeled robot move. I had some experience with image detection before, but I definitely gained some new knowledge on that. I had never used a depth camera before, so that was also a learning experience.

==== What would you do differently next time?

I would pester the mechanic and electronic more, so we could actually get a robot finished in time. We somehow qualified for the first test competition, even though we got a thrower 3 days before the competition, and got it attached to the robot properly only a day before the competition. We barely had any time to test how well it actually works. The same thing happened with Delta X - we got our robot assembled with old electronics only hours before the competition, which meant that I had no time to test and find any low hanging issues, such as the robot sending speeds that are too small. They were things that could've come out during testing, but I didn't have any time for that.

==== What did you like/did not like about the course/building a robot?

I liked when I wrote code that actually made the robot behave in the way I intended. It was fun making something that could actually compete with other groups robots, even though we only had 3 members. I did not like having mechanical issues - wheels falling off, the thrower falling off etc. I was a programmer, yet I had to deal with reattaching wheels countless times. At least for Delta X we finally got a robot that seemed to stay in one piece. 

About the course itself, I feel like some planning could've been better. The date for Delta X shouldn't have had to be changed later on. There were also times when we got conflicting information from instructors and related parties regarding the event. There definitely were some communication issues somewhere.

==== Suggestions for next year students.

Try to get mechanics and electronics complete as soon as possible. Having new mechanics can change a lot how the robot behaves, so code needs to be adapted for that. Having new electronics would change it even more, most likely requiring rewrites in the code. We never got that far, though.

Also, remember that "try: except(specific error): finally:" will eat any errors other than "specific error". Make sure you also turn off the motors when stopping the code (whenever possible), because you don't want your robot driving away in a random direction after it's been shut down. 

==== Suggestions for instructors.

The course was fine, the instructors were helpful.

==== On which parts of the robot did you work on?

I worked on the electronics and firmware. I also helped out a bit with the software.

==== What did you learn?

I learned a lot about PCB design and electronics in general. This was the second PCB I had ever designed, so there was a lot to learn. I also learned a lot about firmware development on the STM32 platform.

==== What would you do differently next time?

I would start working hard on the electronics at the very beggining to have more time to work on firmware and to debug multitudes of electronics issues.

==== What did you like/did not like about the course/building a robot?

The course gave a lot of freedom to do fun stuff building and programming a robot almost from scratch and I learned a ton from this course. Negative was that I started putting a lot of time into doing the electronics and firmware way too late into the course, so the last two weeks were a massive crunch.

==== Suggestions for next year students.

Start doing stuff way way earlier. There is a lot more work to be done than it may seem at first glance.

==== Suggestions for instructors.

Communication with instructors could be better. At some points of time it took a lot of time to get a reply from them. Also there was some confusion in regards to how the competitions are organized.

=== Jens
''''
==== On which parts of the robot did you work on?

I dealt with the physical side - mechanics. If it didn't have any electronics in it, it was most likely under my supervision.

==== What did you learn?

I got to learn a new program and the usage of various powertools. The program was Fusion 360, which was used to sketch out and design the physical parts. Now to put the designs into reality, I got to learn and make use of the CNC machine and lathe. 

==== What would you do differently next time?

Maybe the philosophy of "I'll do it the night before deadline" was not so wise. (like writing this 8 hours before the deadline)

==== What did you like/did not like about the course/building a robot?

I liked Fusion 360 (over SolidWorks), most likely going to keep using it as long as the educational license lasts. Getting the Delta keycard was also neat. In general I got to learn new tools, both digital and physical, latter being a nice change of pace from the usual.
However the course should've yielded more EAPs. :^)

==== Suggestions for next year students.

Just don't be lazy, it's not this hard.

==== Suggestions for instructors.

I got my things checked out in a reasonable timeframe and the instructions on using the powertools was clear. I don't really have anything to suggest.
